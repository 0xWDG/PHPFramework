**PHP In Swift**

*A Swift framework to use the most common PHP functions (Based on PHP7)*

---

I'd like PHP, and PHP is easy to use.
Why not make some PHP functions in Swift, so that you can use them in Swift!

Please note that this project is not fully done right now.

*This framework is not affiliated with the PHP Group*
